title: Common House
---

A shared space used for community resources and activities. Often this includes a kitchen and dining room where residents can socialise and spend time together outside of their own homes. It may also include guest rooms, a laundry, play room, workshop - whatever the community decides it wants. Guest rooms in the common house may allow people to choose a house with fewer bedrooms, saving them money.
