title: Social Spaces

Sites are designed to encourage social interaction. The common house may be in sight of everyone’s house so you can see what is going on. Pathways cross so people are more likely to meet. A children’s recreation space would likely be central and cars kept to the outside edge for safety and to reduce pollution.
