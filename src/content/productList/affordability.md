Smaller energy efficient homes with the possibly an element of self-build may make houses cheaper to build and run. Some aspects - the common house or high eco standards for example - can make the initial investment higher. It would require some kind of subsidy, or partnership with a housing association, to provide affordable housing as part of the community.
