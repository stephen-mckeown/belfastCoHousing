There is often a mix of housing, flats, small houses and family houses - to reflect local need and the choices of the residents. In an urban area, where space is restricted, they may have the vertical construction of an apartment block. They are built to as high an eco-standard as possible, to reduce energy use and environmental impact. Homes should be adaptable to suit people at all stages of life (and taste).
