While everyone has their own private home and front door, some resources may be shared to save money, reduce environmental impact or to be more sociable. There could be a community heating scheme, solar panels, a car and bike pool, an allotment, a tool store. There could be work groups for maintenance etc, lift sharing, and activity groups, such as a film club or exercise classes
